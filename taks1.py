# Task 1: Working with Variables and Basic Operations
# Instructions:
# Create three variables:

# a, an integer (e.g., 7)
# b, a float (e.g., 3.5)
# name, a string (your name or any text you like)
# Perform and print the following operations:

# Add a and b, then print the result.
# Multiply a by b, and print the result.
# Combine (concatenate) the variable name with another string, such as " is learning Python!", and print the result.
# Create a Boolean variable is_learning and set it to True. Print a statement that combines this variable with a sentence, e.g., "Is learning Python? True"

a = 7
b = 3.5
name = "Tanmoy"

print(a+b)
print(a*b)
print (name + " is learning Python!")

is_learning = True
print("Is learning Python", is_learning)
